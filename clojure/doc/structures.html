  <h1>Structures used in the search program:</h1>

  <h3>Tree Representation:</h3>
  <div class="mathtext">
    <p>
      Let a list of the form $[A, B, C]$ represent a phylogenetic tree (where $A$, $B$, and $C$ identify sequences sampled from distinct organisms) that groups $B$ and $C$ closer to each other than either to $A$ in terms of the evolutionary distances of $A$, $B$, and $C$ from a hypothetical common ancestor. That is to say, if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the evolutionary distances of these sequences, respectively, from their common ancestor, then $[A, B, C]$ implies $|b-c| &lt; |a-b|$ and $|b-c| &lt; |a-c|$. Thus $[A, B, C]$ can be equivalently stated $[A, C, B]$. The corresponding tree could be written $(A (B C))$. Since $A$ is on the outside of the evolutionary structure, we say that the tree is <i>framed</i> by $A$, and that $A$ is the <i>frame</i> of the tree. Further, we (due to the structure of instances of hybridization, described below) call the pair of more-closely-grouped sequences the <i>hinge</i> of the tree.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Potential Hybridization:</h3>
  <div class="mathtext">
    <p>
      If the sequences identified by $A$ and $B$ or $A$ and $C$ were sampled from organisms of the same species, and the other sequence (identified by $C$ or $B$, respectively) from a distinct species, then the tree $[A, B, C]$ is an instance of <i>potential hybridization</i>. Potential hybridization needs to be confirmed by checking for <i>reciprocal non-monophyly</i>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Reciprocal Non-monophyly:</h3>
  <div class="mathtext">
    <p>
      Let $A^h$ and $A^k$ identify sequences sampled from distinct organisms of species $A$.<br/>
      Let $B^l$ and $B^m$ identify sequences sampled from distinct organisms of species $B$.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Theorem:</b> A <i>reciprocal non-monophyletic</i> relationship exists between species $A$ and $B$ if and only if for the tree $[A^h, B^m, A^k]$ there exists a corresponding tree $[B^l, B^m, A^k]$.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of our search program, this pair of trees $[[A^h, B^m, A^k], [B^l, B^m, A^k]]$ is termed an <i>instance of hybridization</i>, and can be said to <i>hinge</i> on the pair of sequences common to both trees. This pair is called the <i>hinge</i> of the instance. Note that the hinge of the instance is also the hinge of each tree in the instance.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>A Note on Looser Constraints:</h3>
  <div class="mathtext">
    <p>
      Let $B^i$ identify a sequence sampled from an organism of species B. This sequence may be equal to any sequence sampled from species B, including $B^l$ or $B^m$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of $[[A^h, B^i, A^k], [B^l, B^m, A^k]]$ is not sufficient to claim an instance of hybridization. This is because this pair does not exclude the situations where $[A^k, B^l, B^i]$ or $[B^m, A^h, A^k]$, so it can not guarantee the existence of $[[A^h, B^m, A^k], [B^l, B^m, A^k]]$ or $[[A^h, B^i, A^k], [B^l, B^i, A^k]]$. There is an intuitive sense, however, that the existence of this structure should improve our confidence in the existence of a reciprocal non-monophyletic relationship between species $A$ and $B$ (we don't yet have evidence of a statistical correlation to hybridization, but it seems likely that one exists). We threfore think that this might be a useful heurestic for guiding the allocation of computational resources on large jobs, in the interest of finding hybrids sooner (i.e. we would dedicate more power to the species pairs where this structure was found).
